Neural network (CNTK)

This program is a simple neural network. We trained the program according to a database. The network predicts how much a house is worth buying. In the database was 4 input, these was the number of rooms, the area (m2), the price and the location of the house (city or town).

For the preparation we used C# programming language with CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Tookit) to make it easier to build the network.
